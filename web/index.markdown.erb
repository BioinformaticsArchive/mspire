# The mspire project

mspire - 'Mass Spectrometry Proteomics in Ruby' is a collection of packages
for working with MS proteomics data in ruby.  It seeks to provide support for
open standards (e.g., parsers for mzData, mzXML, mzML, Peptide/Protein Prophet
and the TPP) and contribute other useful functionality for working with mass
spectrometry data in ruby.

_mspire_ is also a gem that includes broad, commonly used packages.
