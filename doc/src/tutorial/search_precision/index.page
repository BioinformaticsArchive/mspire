### Determining False Identification Rates

There are two flavors for estimating a false identification rate for
protein identification search engines.  The first method
(['Cat-DB'](cat_db_search.html)) uses a concatenated database where decoy
proteins are placed after normal proteins in a fasta file.  The other is to
use [Protein Prophet](prophet.html).
