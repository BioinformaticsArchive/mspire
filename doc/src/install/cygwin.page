Installing (and updating) mspire under cygwin
=============================================

## 1. Download and run cygwin setup

Download and run setup.exe from [the main cygwin site](http://www.cygwin.com/)
and make sure to select the following specific packages. 

## 2. Install specific packages

Select to install a few packages from the main cygwin setup:

    Devel -> gcc
    Devel -> make
    Interpreters -> ruby
    Text -> expat
    Text -> libexpat

    # optional:
    Devel -> libxml2
    Devel -> libxml2-devel

Make sure that you *DO NOT* have the native windows ruby installed if you are running the cygwin ruby.

## 3. Download and install [ruby's xmlparser wrapper](http://www.yoshidam.net/Ruby.html)

In a cygwin terminal, unzip the package (`tar -xzvf xmlparser-0.6.8.tar.gz`)
and cd into the xmlparser directory.  Then type:

    ruby extconf.rb --with-expat-lib=/usr/lib --with-expat-include=/usr/include
    make
    make site-install

## 4. Download and install [rubygems](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126)

You want the latest `.tgz` package.  After downloading, in a cygwin terminal,
unzip the package (`tar -xzvf rubygems*.tar.gz`), cd into the rubygems
directory and type:

    ruby setup.rb

You'll need to specify that you want to use gems.  There are [multiple ways to
do this](http://rubygems.org/read/chapter/3#page70).  One way is to cut and
paste this into your terminal:

    echo "export RUBYOPT='rubygems'" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

From then on, every time you open a cygwin terminal (since it always reads
your .bashrc file), rubygems will be turned on.

## 5. Install libxml-ruby (optional)

    gem install libxml-ruby

## 6. Install axml

    gem install axml

## 7. Install mspire

In the cygwin terminal type:

    gem install mspire

This installs the mspire package in `/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/`.  The
executables work from the cygwin command line. (e.g., type `fasta_shaker.rb`)
    
## 8. Update mspire

If you want to ensure you have the latest version, open a terminal and type:

    gem update mspire

You can also check to see if you have the latest version by comparing version numbers:

    gem list mspire --remote
    gem list mspire --local
