.srg files
----------

A .srg file is a text file with path names to .srf files.  Paths may be
absolute or relative (absolute is much safer).

    # <Inside 'file.srg'>
    /my/path/to/file1.srf
    /my/path/to/file2.srf
    /my/path/to/file3.srf

mspire includes an executable for creating these files with little effort.  It will use complete pathnames for each file:

    srf_group.rb file1.srf file2.srf file3.srf  # => bioworks.srg

Note that some mspire executables will automatically create a .srg file from
.srf file input.
